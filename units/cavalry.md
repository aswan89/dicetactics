# Cavalry
Cavalry are fast units that are strongest when used as a group but can be picked apart easily when separated. They are represented by a "three" face on a die.

## Combat
When alone, a unit of cavalry attacks and defends at *combat strength* 3 on all sides per the normal pip calculations. When cavalry are adjacent to other friendly cavalry, however, they can double their strength to 6 on one of their edges. Specifically, a cavalry unit that is adjacent to a friendly cavalry unit such that the two units form a "wedge" with their pips have a *combat strength* of 6 on the edges that form the "point" of the wedge.

## Movement
Cavalry do not have any specific restrictions or bonuses to their movement.

## Special Rules
Cavalry units may take a single free action, either an attack or a move, at the beginning of each turn.
