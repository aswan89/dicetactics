# Units

Each unit on the battlefield is a given type, determined by which die face is facing up when the unit is placed during setup. Units of a given type can have unique movement rules, combat strengths, or other properties, allowing commanders to tailor their force composition to their overall strategic goals. Units may not change type during the course of a battle.
