# Skirmishers
Skirmishers are flexible, maneuverable units well suited to breaking up tightly packed formations of more powerful units. They are represented by a "two" face, showing two pips at opposite corners of the die.

## Combat
In traditional combat, skirmishers have 2 *combat strength* on all edges since each edge has a single pip adjacent to it. Skirmishers may also perform a special ranged attack against units 1 square away from them. The ranged attack is made using both face pips at strength 4 and requires the attacker and defender to move as they would during a normal attack. Defenders may not use unit specific defensive bonuses when defending against a skirmisher's ranged attack.

## Movement
In addition to the normal movement action, skirmishers may make a diagonal movement along the line defined by the two pips on the unit face. The other diagonal is still restricted and may not be used for movement.

## Special Rules
Skirmishers do not have any additional special rules.
