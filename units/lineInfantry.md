# Line Infantry
Line Infantry form the backbone of an army. They are very strong when in position, but require lengthy maneuvering and are vulnerable to flanking attacks. They are represented by a "six" face on a die.

## Combat
Line Infantry are strength 6 on each edge with 3 pips but only strength 4 on the edges with 2 pips.

## Movement
Line Infantry may make attacks without restriction, but may only move in the direction of their edges with 2 pips. This requires commanders to spend an action rotating line infantry in place before moving them in a new direction.

## Special Rules
Line Infantry have no additional special rules.
