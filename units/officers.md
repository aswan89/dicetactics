# Officers
Officers are the weakest individual units in any **Dice Tactics** army, but provide enormous bonuses to the force as a whole. They are represented by the "one" face of the die, showing a single pip.

## Combat
Officer units have a *combat strength* of 1 on all edges due to the single pip in the center of the die face, meaning that any other unit may successfully attack an officer. Officers should be considered extremely delicate and protected closely!

## Movement
Officers do not have any restrictions on movement.

## Special Rules
Each officer under a commander's control gives that commander an action to use during each turn, meaning an army with more officers can perform more movement and attack actions each turn. However, a force with more officers could be considerably weaker than their opponent. Officers that are removed from the battle no longer contribute an action each turn. An army with no officers is considered *routed* and its commander loses the game.
