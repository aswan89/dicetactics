# Introduction

**Dice Tactics** is a tactical dice game for two players that plays more like Chess than Yahtzee. Dice are used to represent six types of units on a square grid battlefield rather than their traditional role as random number generators. Each player will compose their army and face off, looking to maneuver into a superior position and achieve their objectives.

When a die is placed on the field, the face showing "up" determines the unit's type. Each unit type has unique behaviors and attributes that can contribute to a given army in a variety of ways, making force composition a key part of each game. As each battle develops, expert commanders will look to use these specialized units to exploit weaknesses and tactical errors in the pursuit of victory.
