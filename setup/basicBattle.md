# Basic Battle
A basic battle is played between two players with 12 units on each side. The board is a standard chess board, 8 spaces by 8 spaces.

To begin, players should roll a die to determine who is the first player and set the board between them.

Once determined, the first player places 3 units of any type on his half of the board. The second player then places 6 of her units on her half of the board. The first player places an additional 6 units, followed by the second player placing another 6 units. Finally, the first player places his 3 remaining units.

With setup complete, play begins and the first player may begin taking his first turn.
