# Movement

Movement in **Dice Tactics** is relatively simple. A command may spend one action to move a unit they control into an unoccupied square of the battlefield. Movements cannot be made diagonally or off the battlefield. Some types of units may have more stringent limitations on their movement, but those will be explained in the detailed unit explanations below. When units move, they must remain in the same orientation after the move is complete, that is, they may not rotate as part of a single movement action.

Units may also be rotated in place by spending an action. While this is not especially useful for symmetrical units, other units may have movement restrictions or combat penalties based on their orientation, making it paramount to ensure they are oriented in the correct direction during battle.
