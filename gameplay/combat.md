# Combat

Combat in **Dice Tactics** can be thought of as "movement against opposition". Like a regular movement action, attacks are made by spending an action to move a unit into a square that is occupied by an enemy unit. Like movement, attacks may not be made diagonally. To determine if the attack is successful, both players will compare the *combat strength* of the attacker and the defender.

A unit's *combat strength* is determined by how many "die pips" are present on the die edge facing the attacker or defender. Each pip that is directly adjacent to the edge contributes 2 *combat strength* to the unit, while pips in the center of the die face contribute 1 *combat strength*. Other pips do not contribute any strength to a given attack, though they can be used during attacks that involve the relevant die edges.

If the attacker has *combat strength* greater than or equal to the defender, the defender is forced to *retreat* to the square directly opposite the source of attack. The attacker moves into the previously occupied square immediately after the attack is resolved. If the *retreat* square is occupied by another unit or would be off the battlefield, the defending unit is removed from the battlefield instead of *retreating*, making flanking and surrounding enemy units a very powerful maneuver.

If the defender has greater *combat strength* than the attacker the attack fails and both units remain in their original position.
