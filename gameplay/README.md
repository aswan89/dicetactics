# Gameplay

At heart, all tactics games are about two things: movement and combat. **Dice Tactics** is no different, but the simple rules for each lead to complex plays and counter-plays between skilled players.

During each turn, players will have a specific number of actions they must use to order their units around the battlefield before passing the turn to their opponent. Turns will pass this way until one player wins, either by destroying all their opponent's officers or by achieving some other objective decided before the game started.
